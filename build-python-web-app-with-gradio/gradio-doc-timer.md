Timer
=====

    gradio.Timer(···)

### Description[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradio-app/gradio/main/js/_website/src/lib/assets/img/anchor.svg)](#description)

Special component that ticks at regular intervals when active. It is not visible, and only used to trigger events at a regular interval through the `tick` event listener.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Behavior[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradio-app/gradio/main/js/_website/src/lib/assets/img/anchor.svg)](#behavior)

**As input component**: The interval of the timer as a float.
-------------------------------------------------------------

##### Your function should accept one of these types:

    def predict(
    	value: float | None
    )
    	...

  

**As output component**: The interval of the timer as a float or None.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Your function should return one of these types:

    def predict(···) -> float | None
    	...	
    	return value

### Initialization[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradio-app/gradio/main/js/_website/src/lib/assets/img/anchor.svg)](#initialization)

Parameters ▼

    value: float

default `= 1`

Interval in seconds between each tick.

    active: bool

default `= True`

Whether the timer is active.

    render: bool

default `= True`

If False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.

Initialization

`gradio.Timer`

### Event Listeners[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradio-app/gradio/main/js/_website/src/lib/assets/img/anchor.svg)](#event-listeners)

#### Description

Event listeners allow you to respond to user interactions with the UI components you've defined in a Gradio Blocks app. When a user interacts with an element, such as changing a slider value or uploading an image, a function is called.

#### Supported Event Listeners

The Timer component supports the following event listeners. Each event listener takes the same parameters, which are listed in the [Event Parameters](#event-listeners-arguments) table below.

Listener

Description

`Timer.tick(fn, ···)`

This listener is triggered at regular intervals defined by the Timer.

#### Event Parameters

Parameters ▼

    fn: Callable | None | Literal['decorator']

default `= "decorator"`

the function to call when this event is triggered. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.

    inputs: Component | BlockContext | list[Component | BlockContext] | Set[Component | BlockContext] | None

default `= None`

List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.

    outputs: Component | BlockContext | list[Component | BlockContext] | Set[Component | BlockContext] | None

default `= None`

List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.

    api_name: str | None | Literal[False]

default `= None`

defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the API docs with the given name. If None (default), the name of the function will be used as the API endpoint. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the API docs and downstream apps (including those that \`gr.load\` this app) will not be able to use this event.

    scroll_to_output: bool

default `= False`

If True, will scroll to output component on completion

    show_progress: Literal['full', 'minimal', 'hidden']

default `= "hidden"`

how to show the progress animation while event is running: "full" shows a spinner which covers the output component area as well as a runtime display in the upper right corner, "minimal" only shows the runtime display, "hidden" shows no progress animation at all

    queue: bool

default `= True`

If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.

    batch: bool

default `= False`

If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length \`max\_batch\_size\`). The function is then \*required\* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.

    max_batch_size: int

default `= 4`

Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)

    preprocess: bool

default `= True`

If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the \`Image\` component).

    postprocess: bool

default `= True`

If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.

    cancels: dict[str, Any] | list[dict[str, Any]] | None

default `= None`

A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=\[click\_event\] will cancel the click\_event, where click\_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.

    trigger_mode: Literal['once', 'multiple', 'always_last'] | None

default `= None`

If "once" (default for all events except \`.change()\`) would not allow any submissions while an event is pending. If set to "multiple", unlimited submissions are allowed while pending, and "always\_last" (default for \`.change()\` and \`.key\_up()\` events) would allow a second submission after the pending event is complete.

    js: str | None

default `= None`

Optional frontend js method to run before running 'fn'. Input arguments for js method are values of 'inputs' and 'outputs', return should be a list of values for output components.

    concurrency_limit: int | None | Literal['default']

default `= "default"`

If set, this is the maximum number of this event that can be running simultaneously. Can be set to None to mean no concurrency\_limit (any number of this event can be running simultaneously). Set to "default" to use the default concurrency limit (defined by the \`default\_concurrency\_limit\` parameter in \`Blocks.queue()\`, which itself is 1 by default).

    concurrency_id: str | None

default `= None`

If set, this is the id of the concurrency group. Events with the same concurrency\_id will be limited by the lowest set concurrency\_limit.

    show_api: bool

default `= True`

whether to show this event in the "view API" page of the Gradio app, or in the ".view\_api()" method of the Gradio clients. Unlike setting api\_name to False, setting show\_api to False will still allow downstream apps as well as the Clients to use this event. If fn is None, show\_api will automatically be set to False.

    time_limit: int | None

default `= None`

    stream_every: float

default `= 0.5`

    like_user_message: bool

default `= False`
